 This package contains a version of BitlBee that uses the libpurple instant
 messaging library instead of built-in code, which adds support for more IM
 protocols (all protocols supported by Pidgin/Finch) and features (like file
 transfers), at the price of being less lightweight.
 .
 This variant may not be very suitable for BitlBee instances used by many
 (tens or hundreds) of clients.
