Description: IRC to other chat networks gateway (using libpurple)
 This program can be used as an IRC server which forwards everything you
 say to people on other chat networks: Jabber (which includes Google
 Talk), and Twitter.
 .
 This package contains a version of BitlBee that uses the libpurple instant
 messaging library instead of built-in code, which adds support for more IM
 protocols (all protocols supported by Pidgin/Finch) and features (like file
 transfers), at the price of being less lightweight.
 .
 If you don't need the extra features, it's better to use the built-in code.
