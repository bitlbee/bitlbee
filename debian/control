Description: IRC to other chat networks gateway (using libpurple)

 messaging library instead of built-in code, which adds support for more IM
 protocols (all protocols supported by Pidgin/Finch) and features (like file
 transfers), at the price of being less lightweight.

 If you don't need the extra features, it's better to use the built-in code.
