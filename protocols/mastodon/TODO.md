# TODO

1. Documentation for the [Streaming API](https://github.com/tootsuite/documentation/blob/master/Using-the-API/Streaming-API.md)

1. We can delete md->follow_ids

1. The API to get the accounts we follow doesn't seem to paginate
   correctly using `since_id`; it keeps returning data with ids below
   the parameter.

1. The streaming API seems not to work. Or our pong is not working. No
   new status are added and after a while the server hangs up on us.

1. Add copyright statements.
