## BitlBee default configuration file
##
## Comments are marked like this. The rest of the file is INI-style. The
## comments should tell you enough about what all settings mean.
##

[settings]

## RunMode:
##
##  Inetd -- Run from inetd (default)
##  Daemon -- Run as a stand-alone daemon, serving all users from one process.
##    This saves memory if there are more users, the downside is that when one
##    user hits a crash-bug, all other users will also lose their connection.
##  ForkDaemon -- Run as a stand-alone daemon, but keep all clients in separate
##    child processes. This should be pretty safe and reliable to use instead
##    of inetd mode.
##
# RunMode = Inetd

## User:
## 
## If BitlBee is started by root as a daemon, it can drop root privileges,
## and change to the specified user.
##
User = bitlbee

## DaemonPort/DaemonInterface:
##
## For daemon mode, you can specify on what interface and port the daemon
## should be listening for connections.
##
# DaemonInterface = 0.0.0.0
# DaemonPort = 6667

## ClientInterface:
##
## If for any reason, you want BitlBee to use a specific address/interface
## for outgoing traffic (IM connections, HTTP(S), etc.), set it here.
##
# ClientInterface = 0.0.0.0

## AuthMode
##
##  Open -- Accept connections from anyone, use NickServ for user authentication.
##    (default)
##  Closed -- Require authorization (using the PASS command during login) before
##    allowing the user to connect at all.
##  Registered -- Only allow registered users to use this server; this disables
##    the register- and the account command until the user identifies himself.
##
# AuthMode = Open

## AuthPassword
##
## Password the user should enter when logging into a closed BitlBee server.
## You can also have an MD5-encrypted password here. Format: "md5:", followed
## by a hash as generated for the <user password=""> attribute in a BitlBee
## XML file (for now there's no easier way to generate the hash).
##
# AuthPassword = ItllBeBitlBee   ## Heh.. Our slogan. ;-)
## or
# AuthPassword = md5:gzkK0Ox/1xh+1XTsQjXxBJ571Vgl

## OperPassword
##
## Password that unlocks access to special operator commands.
##
# OperPassword = ChangeMe!
## or
# OperPassword = md5:I0mnZbn1t4R731zzRdDN2/pK7lRX

## HostName
##
## Normally, BitlBee gets a hostname using getsockname(). If you have a nicer
## alias for your BitlBee daemon, you can set it here and BitlBee will identify
## itself with that name instead.
##
# HostName = localhost

## MotdFile
##
## Specify an alternative MOTD (Message Of The Day) file. Default value depends
## on the --etcdir argument to configure.
##
# MotdFile = /etc/bitlbee/motd.txt

## ConfigDir
##
## Specify an alternative directory to store all the per-user configuration
## files. (.nicks/.accounts)
##
# ConfigDir = /var/lib/bitlbee

## Ping settings
##
## BitlBee can send PING requests to the client to check whether it's still
## alive. This is not very useful on local servers, but it does make sense
## when most clients connect to the server over a real network interface.
## (Public servers) Pinging the client will make sure lost clients are
## detected and cleaned up sooner.
##
## PING requests are sent every PingInterval seconds. If no PONG reply has
## been received for PingTimeOut seconds, BitlBee aborts the connection.
##
## To disable the pinging, set at least one of these to 0.
##
# PingInterval = 180
# PingTimeOut = 300

## Using proxy servers for outgoing connections
##
## If you're running BitlBee on a host which is behind a restrictive firewall
## and a proxy server, you can tell BitlBee to use that proxy server here.
## The setting has to be a URL, formatted like one of these examples:
##
## (Obviously, the username and password are optional)
##
## Proxy = http://john:doe@proxy.localnet.com:8080
## Proxy = socks4://socksproxy.localnet.com
## Proxy = socks5://socksproxy.localnet.com


[defaults]

## Here you can override the defaults for some per-user settings. Users are
## still able to override your defaults, so this is not a way to restrict
## your users...

## To enable private mode by default, for example:

## private = 1
